CombatTextPlus is a powerful World of Warcraft addon designed to enhance your combat experience by providing highly customizable combat text. This addon allows you to modify the appearance, movement, and behavior of combat text, ensuring that important damage and healing information is displayed in a way that suits your playstyle. Whether you prefer subtle indicators or flashy, dynamic text, CombatTextPlus gives you the control you need.

Key Features
Customizable Scroll Duration:

Scroll Duration: Adjust how quickly the combat text moves across the screen. This allows you to make the text scroll faster or slower, depending on your preference.
Configuration: Can be adjusted in the settings under the "Scroll Duration" option.
Adjustable Text Movement:

Max Y Offset: Controls the maximum vertical distance that the text will move as it scrolls. This helps prevent text from moving too far off the screen.
Speed Factor: Change the speed at which the text moves. This can make the combat text more dynamic or more static, depending on your preference.
Damage Type Offsets: Customize the horizontal movement of text based on the type of damage (Physical, Holy, Fire, etc.). This allows you to have different behaviors for different types of damage, such as zig-zagging or spiraling text.
Color Customization:

Damage Type Colors: Assign specific colors to different types of damage (e.g., Physical, Holy, Fire) to make them easily distinguishable during combat.
Label Colors: Customize the colors of the labels that appear next to damage types, helping you quickly identify what type of damage is being displayed.
Font and Size Adjustments:

Font Selection: Choose from a variety of fonts to style your combat text, allowing for a personalized and thematic look.
Font Size: Adjust the size of the combat text to make it more prominent or subtle, depending on your needs.
Damage Type Filters:

Enable/Disable Specific Damage Types: You can choose to display or hide certain types of damage. For example, if you only care about Fire damage, you can disable all other damage types from being displayed.
Dynamic DOT (Damage Over Time) Behavior:

DOT Y Offset Multiplier: Control how much the DOT text moves vertically. This feature ensures that DOT damage stands out by giving it a unique movement pattern.
Minimap Button:

Toggle Minimap Button: You can choose to show or hide the minimap button for quick access to the addon’s settings.
Profile Management:

Profiles: Save and switch between different configuration profiles, making it easy to switch settings for different characters or situations.
Blizzard Combat Text Integration:

Automatic Disabling of Blizzard Scrolling Combat Text: CombatTextPlus will disable Blizzard’s default scrolling combat text to prevent overlapping. If you prefer to use Blizzard’s text, you can easily re-enable it by typing /console floatingCombatTextCombatDamage 1.
How Things Work
CombatTextPlus hooks into the WoW combat log to capture damage, healing, and other combat-related events. When a relevant event is detected (like taking damage or dealing damage), the addon displays the information on your screen using the settings you’ve configured.

The movement of the combat text is determined by various parameters such as scrollDuration, speedFactor, and maxYOffset, which dictate how long and how far the text will scroll before fading out. You can also adjust how the text behaves for different types of damage through the damageTypeOffsets settings, which allow for different horizontal movements.
